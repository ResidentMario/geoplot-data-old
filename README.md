# geoplot-data-old

This repo is an archive of data used while building `geoplot`. This data was my test data while I was working on the project, and I used much of it for the examples as well. However I did it kind of haphazardously. The canonical datasets now zipped directly into the repository in the `datasets` submodule are modifications of the data here, but nobody but me should have much interest in this stuff.

See `geoplot-data` for the current raw inputs.
